# Pilgrim

Welcome to the Pilgrim project repository!

## Overview

Pilgrim is an AI-powered chatbot designed to provide accessible and stigma-free mental health support. With Pilgrim, users can access confidential and personalized assistance from a virtual psychiatrist anytime, anywhere. By breaking down barriers to seeking help, Pilgrim aims to make mental health support more accessible and inclusive for all.

## App

The `App` folder contains the code for the Pilgrim mobile application. Built with Flutter, the Pilgrim app provides users with a convenient way to access Pilgrim on their mobile devices.
